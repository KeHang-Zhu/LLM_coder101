# How to build a chatbot website?
This guide will show you how a beginner can use ChatGPT-4 to build a chatbot website. I'll walk you through how to ask questions to ChatGPT-4, providing an easy example to help beginners with basic knowledge about Python start programming with ChatGPT-4 and see what they can do.

For someone just starting out, the first thing to do is decide what you want to create. In this blog, my goal is to build a chatbot that can talk to you like a boyfriend or girlfriend.

After setting my goal, the next step is to plan out the steps I'll follow. Let's ask ChatGPT-4 for help with this!

I started by asking ChatGPT-4:
```
I'm just starting out with programming, and I want to make a website where people can use the ChatGPT-4 API to create a boyfriend/girlfriend chatbot using Python. I only know that I want to use Python. Can you teach me how to do this step by step?
```

Here’s what I received from ChatGPT-4:

> That's a great project idea! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a website with a ChatGPT-4 based virtual boyfriend/girlfriend chatbot:
>
> ### Step 1: Learn the Basics of Web Development
>
> Before diving into API integration, you'll need a solid understanding of the basics of web development. Here are the key technologies to learn:
>
> 1. **HTML**: The structure of your web pages.
> 2. **CSS**: The styling of your web pages.
> 3. **JavaScript**: The programming language to make your web pages interactive.
>
> 
> ...

I'm not looking to learning everything; as newcomers, I have heard of HTML and CSS but have no idea what they actually entail. My objective is to build this chatbot website in just two days, not spend a year studying. Therefore, I may need to adjust my prompt slightly. Let’s make another new request to ChatGPT-4:

```
Could you give me:
1. A clear, ordered list of steps tailored to my project.
2. Detailed actions I need to execute for each step.
3. The exact code snippets or files required at each step.

Please focus on specific instructions and avoid general advice or broad learning suggestions.
```

In the second pass, I got something much better:

> ### Step 1: Install Python and Flask
> **Actions:**
> 1. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
> 2. Open your terminal or command prompt and install Flask using pip:
>    ```bash
>    pip install Flask
>    ```
>
> ### Step 2: Create a New Flask Application
> **Actions:**
> 1. Create a new directory for your project, `chatbot_app`.
> 2. Inside this directory, create a new file named `app.py`.
> 3. Paste the following code into `app.py` to set up a basic Flask server:
>    ```python
>    from flask import Flask, render_template
>
>    app = Flask(__name__)
>
>    @app.route('/')
>    def home():
>        return render_template('index.html')
>
>    if __name__ == '__main__':
>        app.run(debug=True)
>    ```
>
> ### Step 3: Create HTML Template for Chat Interface
> **Actions:**
> 1. Inside the `chatbot_app` directory, create a subdirectory called `templates`.
> 2. Inside `templates`, create a new file named `index.html`.
> 3. Paste the following HTML code into `index.html`:
>    ```html
>    <!DOCTYPE html>
>    <html lang="en">
>    <head>
>        <meta charset="UTF-8">
>        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
>        <title>Chat with your Virtual Friend</title>
>    </head>
>    <body>
>        <h1>Welcome to Your Virtual Friend Chatbot</h1>
>        <div id="chat-container">
>            <!-- Messages will be displayed here -->
>        </div>
>        <input type="text" id="user-input" placeholder="Say something..." />
>        <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
>
>        <script>
>            function sendMessage() {
>                const userText = document.getElementById('user-input').value;
>                // Add more code here later to send the userText to the server
>                console.log("Sending message:", userText);
>            }
>        </script>
>    </body>
>    </html>
>    ```
>
> ### Step 4: Sign Up for OpenAI and Set Up API Integration
> **Actions:**
> 1. Sign up for an API key at [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/).
> 2. Install the `openai` Python library in your terminal:
>    ```bash
>    pip install openai
>    ```
> 3. Add the API key handling in your `app.py`:
>    ```python
>    import openai
>
>    openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'
>
>    def get_chatbot_response(message):
>        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
>            model="gpt-4",
>            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message}]
>        )
>        return response.choices[0].message['content']
>    ```
>
> ### Step 5: Connect Frontend to Backend
> **Actions:**
> 1. Update your `sendMessage` function in `index.html` to make an AJAX request to the Flask server:
>    ```javascript
>    function sendMessage() {
>        const userText = document.getElementById('user-input').value;
>        fetch('/send_message', {
>            method: 'POST',
>            headers: {
>                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
>            },
>            body: JSON.stringify({message: userText})
>        })
>        .then(response => response.json())
>        .then(data => {
>            console.log("Received:", data.reply);
>            // Add code here to display the message in chat-container
>        });
>    }
>    ```
> 2. Add a new route in `app.py` to handle the AJAX request:
>    ```python
>    @app.route('/send_message', methods=['POST'])
>    def handle_message():
>        message = request.json['message']
>        reply = get_chatbot_response(message)
>        return jsonify({'reply': reply})
>    ```
>
> ### Step 6: Test Your Application
> **Actions:**
> 1. Run your Flask application by running `python app.py` from your terminal.
> 2. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see your chatbot in action.
>
> ### Step 7: Deploy Your Application
> **Actions:**
> 1. Choose a platform like Heroku for deployment. Follow the specific steps for deploying a Flask app to Heroku, including setting up a `Procfile` and `requirements.txt`.
>
> This guide provides specific steps and code snippets to help you start your project. Each step builds on the previous one, setting up your web application from scratch and integrating it with the ChatGPT-4 API. Let me know if you need more details on any of these steps!

 Let me use this guide as my roadmap and begin working on the project!

(Skipping Step 1 for now; I'll come back and revise this section later.)

I can now move on to Steps 2, 3, 4, and 5, which should be straightforward since they mainly involve copying and pasting code and creating directories. However, one thing I might keep running into is wondering if we're on the right track with each step. It might be better to check things as I go rather than waiting to test everything at the end. This way, I can catch any issues early. But, how can I do that?

Let's turn to my best mentor, ChatGPT-4, once again:

```
Can you show me some straightforward ways to check that I've completed each step you gave me correctly?
```

And then I got something like:

> Certainly! Here's how you can verify that each step has been completed correctly:
>
> ### Step 1: Install Python and Flask
> **Verification:**
> 1. **Check Python Installation:** Open your terminal or command prompt and type `python --version`. This should return the Python version number, confirming that Python is installed correctly.
> 2. **Check Flask Installation:** In the same terminal, type `python -m flask --version`. This should display the Flask version along with its dependencies, indicating that Flask is installed.
>
> ### Step 2: Create a New Flask Application
> **Verification:**
> 1. **Check App Setup:** Run your Flask application by navigating to your project directory in the terminal and running `python app.py`. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message like *Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/* in your terminal.
>
> ### Step 3: Create HTML Template for Chat Interface
> **Verification:**
> 1. **Check HTML Rendering:** With your Flask server running, open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You should see the web page with the title "Chat with your Virtual Friend" and a basic input and send button layout.
>
> ### Step 4: Sign Up for OpenAI and Set Up API Integration
> **Verification:**
> 1. **Test API Key:** Add a test function in your `app.py` that calls the `get_chatbot_response` with a test message like "Hello". Run this test in your terminal. If the setup is correct, you should see a response from the ChatGPT model printed in your terminal.
>
> ### Step 5: Connect Frontend to Backend
> **Verification:**
> 1. **Check AJAX Functionality:** After updating your frontend and backend code to communicate, check your browser's developer console for messages being sent and received. When you type a message and click send, you should see the sent message and received reply logged in the console, indicating that the communication is working.
>
> ### Step 6: Test Your Application
> **Verification:**
> 1. **Comprehensive Test:** Interact with your chatbot through the web interface. The chatbot should be able to respond to various inputs, and the responses should appear on the webpage.
>
> ### Step 7: Deploy Your Application
> **Verification:**
> 1. **Access Application Online:** After deploying to a platform like Heroku, visit the provided URL to access your application. If it loads and functions the same as it did locally, your deployment was successful.
>
> These checks will help ensure that you're on the right track at each stage of your project. Let me know if you run into any issues or if there's anything else you'd like to know!

After I wrapped up part 2 and decided to give it a test run, I typed in python app.py in the terminal, but hit a snag. It threw back an error saying /usr/local/bin/python: can't open file '/Users/haonanw/Desktop/LLM_coder101/chatbot/app.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory. Looks like it couldn’t find the app.py file. Time to dig around and see what went wrong!

```
Here's a rewritten version of your prompt:

I completed Step 2 as follows:

**Step 2: Create a New Flask Application**

**Actions:**

1. Create a new directory for your project named `chatbot_app`.
2. Within this directory, create a new file called `app.py`.
3. Insert the following code into `app.py` to establish a basic Flask server:

from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

**Verification:**
To verify this step, I attempted to run the Flask application. I navigated to the project directory in the terminal and executed the command `python app.py`. Ideally, the terminal should display a message like "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/". However, I encountered the following error:

/usr/local/bin/python: can't open file '/Users/haonanw/Desktop/LLM_coder101/chatbot/app.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory.

What might be causing this error, given the steps I've completed, the checks I've conducted, and the error message I've received? Could you take a detailed guess at some possible causes and rank them by how likely they are?
``````

And I get:

> Based on the error message you received and the steps you've completed, here are some potential causes for the error ranked by likelihood:
>
> 1. **Incorrect Directory Navigation**:
>    - **Likelihood**: Very High
>    - **Explanation**: The error message indicates that the terminal cannot find `app.py` at the specified path. This usually happens if you're not in the correct directory when you try to run the Python script. 
>    - **Solution**: Ensure that you are in the `chatbot_app` directory before running `python app.py`. You can navigate to the correct directory using the `cd` command. For example:
>      ```bash
>      cd path/to/your/chatbot_app
>      ```
>      Replace `path/to/your` with the actual path to where you've created your `chatbot_app` directory.
>
> 2. **File Naming/Creation Error**:
>    - **Likelihood**: High
>    - **Explanation**: There might have been an error or typo when creating or naming the `app.py` file. It's possible the file does not exist because it was not saved correctly, or it was saved with a different name or in a different location than intended.
>    - **Solution**: Double-check that `app.py` is indeed in the `chatbot_app` directory. You can check the contents of your current directory using the `ls` command in the terminal.
>
> 3. **Permission Issues**:
>    - **Likelihood**: Medium
>    - **Explanation**: If there are permission restrictions on the directory or the `app.py` file, the script might not run correctly. This is less likely if you created the file on your own system without modifying permissions.
>    - **Solution**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and execute the file. You can modify permissions using the `chmod` command if necessary:
>      ```bash
>      chmod +rwx app.py
>      ```
>
> 4. **Python Installation Issues**:
>    - **Likelihood**: Low
>    - **Explanation**: If Python is not installed correctly, or if there are multiple Python versions causing confusion, it could potentially lead to issues when trying to execute a Python script. However, this is less likely since the error message specifically indicates a file path issue.
>    - **Solution**: Verify that Python is installed correctly by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` depending on your setup.
>
> To diagnose and fix the issue, start by ensuring you're in the correct directory and that the `app.py` file exists and is correctly named. From there, attempt to run the file again, and if the problem persists, check for permission issues or potential problems with your Python installation.

The error guess provided by ChatGPT-4 is actually accurate! I had forgotten to switch directories into the chatbot_app directory. However, after changing the directory, I ran into a new issue: jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: index.html. Let's ask ChatGPT-4 once again:


```
I've resolved the previous issues I mentioned, but now I'm encountering a new error: `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: index.html`.

What might be causing this error, given the steps I've completed, the checks I've conducted, and the error message I've received? Could you take a detailed guess at some possible causes and rank them by how likely they are?
```

And I get 

> The error `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: index.html` indicates that Flask is unable to find the `index.html` template when trying to render it. Here are the most likely causes for this issue, ranked from most likely to least likely:
> 
> 1. **Template File in Wrong Directory**: Flask expects the HTML templates to be in a folder named `templates` within the same directory where your `app.py` is located. Make sure you have a `templates` directory in your `chatbot_app` folder and that `index.html` is correctly placed inside this directory.
> 
> 2. **Incorrect File Name**: It's possible the file name is misspelled or not exactly `index.html`. Double-check the spelling and case of your file name in the `templates` folder.
> 
> 3. **Path Issues**: If you are running the Flask app from a different directory, or if your Flask app is configured unusually, Flask might not be able to construct the correct path to the `templates` directory. Ensure that you are running the `app.py` file from its directory:
> 
> ```bash
> cd /path/to/chatbot_app
> python app.py
> ```
> 
> 4. **File Corruption or Missing File**: The `index.html` file could have been accidentally deleted or corrupted after you created it. Verify that the file is still present and that it is readable.
> 
> 5. **Configuration Issue in Flask**: This is less common, but if there are custom configurations in your Flask application that modify the expected locations for templates, this could cause the issue. If you have added or modified configurations related to template folders in `app.py`, check those settings.
> 
> To resolve this issue, start with these steps:
> 
> - **Verify Directory and File Name**: Go to your `chatbot_app` directory and ensure there is a `templates` folder with `index.html` inside it. Use `ls` in the terminal to list directories and files:
> 
> ```bash
> cd /path/to/chatbot_app
> ls # Check for 'templates' directory
> cd templates
> ls # Check for 'index.html'
> ```
> 
> - **Check Running Directory**: Make sure you are in the `chatbot_app` directory when you start the Flask app.
> 
> - **Inspect the `index.html` File**: Open it in a text editor to confirm it's not empty or corrupted.
> 
> Following these steps should help you resolve the `TemplateNotFound` error. If the problem persists, double-check each step or provide more details so I can help further!


When I verified the directory name and file name, I realized that the TemplateNotFound error occurred because I hadn't created the templates folder and index.html file yet (This is in part 3). To resolve this, I completed part 3 of the tutorial and then rechecked the steps in part 2 and part 3.
